            <div>
                I began this project as a way to challenge my creativity and my skills. This project is 
                writen in React to manage the UI and API calls as well as some different libraries, before I started this 
                project, I had some experience with React at the time so I decided this is a great oportunity to improve my 
                skills and learn new ways to implement what I already knew.
            </div>

            <div style={{marginTop: '1rem', paddingBottom: '5rem'}}>
                This project was written in React for managing the UI. I divided the page into 4 panes.
                <br/>
                The top left pane is uses a quote api, to display famous quotes that can motivate whoever decides
                 to visit this page, there's also a copy button, just in case anyone would like to copy the quote. 
                <br/>

                    ðŸ”— Here is the Api endpoint
                </a>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The top right pane has a showcase of the various subject, some of them are programming related and others 
                art projects, each one has a modal associated to it, all of the styling is documented in the github repo for this
                site.

                <br/>
                The bottom left one has my full name with some animations to reveal some buttons to display the "About me" section
                as well as the button for these same modal.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The bottom right pane has all my contact info and all the places where I am active. Feel free to contact me however you'd like.

                And last but not least, the background was made with the p5.js library, its drawing a flocking simulation, also known as Boids which simulates the way birds fly in groups withouth hitting eachother.
                 It also draws where the cursor is and it replaces it with a circle with a tail dragging behind it. The full code for the sketch is in the repo for this project.
